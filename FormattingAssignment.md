## **Solar Glass: A Better Alternative to Traditional Solar Panels?** 

Glass solar panels are window panes that can turn sunlight into energy through photovoltaic (PV) cells. PV cells convert light into electricity just like a traditional solar panel does but with the bonus of being transparent(Mag, S, 2020). However, unlike the conventional solar panel, one doesn’t need to allocate land for the solar fields or mount it on your home's roof. This allows it to blend well into your home's aesthetic without giving up on your renewable energy dreams.

This technical description informs readers of the differences between glass solar panels and their sister product, the solar panel. Additionally, how the glass panels function will be discussed in more detail later, along with their advantages over traditional solar panels and the countless applications solar glass has to offer.

### ***Capabilities of Glass Solar Panels***

Solar panels can become transparent(defined as the ability to see through something with no obstruction to view) while retaining their light Absorption capabilities. Solar glass allows hundreds of new capabilities and environmentally conscious opportunities for the world. Not only can glass solar panels be used for Windows, but they can also be used for car sunroofs, Mobile devices, laptops, e-readers, and skyscrapers. It could turn every building in the world into a solar producer.

## **How Solar Glass Produces Electricity**

The introduction of transparent luminescent solar concentrator(TLSC), an item designed to absorb specific wavelengths of invisible UV (Ultra Violet) and infrared light(Mag, S, 2020). Because those wavelengths can be transferred to the PV cells that line the edges of the window pane, the PV cells can be converted into electricity. The PV cells will allow the solar panels to function like a window (be transparent) while also producing electricity.

### ***How Each Layer Functions***

Solar glass comprises five layers—7 if you add the optional AR(Anti-reflective) coating to both ends/sides of the surface (see Figure 3), reducing light reflection and allowing more light to pass through. The five required layers and their functions are as follows: 

* The thickest layer is typically a transparent material such as glass or plastic(Stauffer, N, 2013).  
*  The other four layers comprise the PV coating, allowing light to pass through while still capturing electricity(Stauffer, N, 2013).   
  - The main layers of the PV coating are the two semiconductor layers: they absorb the sunlight, creating a field that produces an electric current(Stauffer, N, 2013).   
  - Next, the electrode layer is used to carry the current to an external circuit(Stauffer, N, 2013).  
  - The final layer, the UV/NIR(Ultraviolet/Near-infrared) Reflector layer located at the back, sends light back through the other layers to convert even more energy(Stauffer, N, 2013).

## **Advantages of Glass Solar Panels**

### ***The Sustainability and Cost-benefit***

One of the most significant advantages of switching to solar panel windows is the sustainability they will generate, which will ultimately lower your bills in the long run, along with the fact that PV cell windows can provide additional shading and thermal insulation to your home. Shading allows the PV cells to block most of the infrared radiation—the part of sunlight that heats a room—reducing the need for window treatments such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems as often. Combined with the added benefit of providing almost a quarter of a building's energy, it would cut back on the frequent need for air conditioning, reducing energy consumption and costs even more.

### ***Traditional Solar Panels vs Glass Solar Panels***

Some of the most significant advantages glass solar panels have over traditional solar panels are listed by Lozanova, S below. (Lozanova, 2022). (See Figure 4 for a visual solar glass example and Figure 1 for a traditional solar panel.)

* One-glass solar panels do not require direct sunlight or specified angles to produce maximum performance like traditional panels, allowing for a wider variety of placement on most building surfaces, including facades.   
* Two, because solar glass can be placed in a variety of ways, it is ideal for densely populated areas with limited rooftop and ground space, which traditional panels require. Solar glass instead uses a building's glass surface to generate power, maximizing efficiency and energy output without additional space.   
* Third and foremost, compared to a traditional solar panel, solar glass can be utilized for more than just converting sunlight into electricity. It has the potential to be used not only as an energy generator but also as a traditional window, allowing for better resource use and energy efficiency.

### ***The Bonus of Aesthetics***

Solar window panels are also more aesthetically pleasing and less obstructive to your property. They allow the solar glass to blend seamlessly into the building design, as the difference between regular and fully transparent solar glass is practically indistinguishable. This provides a way to seamlessly be eco-friendly and energy-conscious without giving up yard or roof space like traditional solar panels.

## **Versatility and Applications of the Panels**

Another bonus to glass solar panels is their versatility; they can come in various shapes and sizes depending on the needs of the person buying or building with the solar panels. One such option is the percentage of transparency one wishes their windows to have. Currently, it is only available in two levels of intensity: partially transparent and fully transparent. 

### ***Partially Transparent Panels***

The partially transparent panels absorb 60% of sunlight(Mag, S, 2020). Partially transparent window panes are ideal for south-facing buildings because reducing transmitted light is essential. Adjusting the values between the transmitted and absorbed light can optimize building performance (Many office buildings already do this by using traditionally tinted glass). Unfortunately, partially transparent comes with the drawback of the PV Cells only working at about 7.2% efficiency(Mag, S, 2020). The partially transparent windows come with the downside of producing less electricity overall. 

### ***Fully Transparent Panels***

However, if that doesn’t appeal to you, you can choose its alternative counterpart: the fully transparent panels. Unlike partial transparency, the full ones have an efficiency rate of 10%, a 2.8% difference(Mag, S, 2020). Moreover, compared to traditional solar panels that typically have an efficiency of 12%, they compensate for this through their potential size variations, allowing them to be incorporated into larger windows and offering a wider range of possible development despite their lower efficiency.

### ***Applications of Solar Glass Panels***

Additionally, solar glass takes little to no energy to create, and the coating can be added to practically any type of surface because it is added close to room temperature. Also included is the fact that glass is not used in fabricating solar glass, an expensive portion of conventional systems(Stauffer, N, 2013).

Allowing it to be environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Along with their versatility, PV cell windows have many applications, including, but not limited to, residential buildings, commercial buildings, urban infrastructure such as the facade, hand-held electronic devices, and vehicles (Mag, S, 2020). 

## **Closing Statements for Why You Should Switch**

Glass solar panels are a monumental step for renewable energy as they have many applications and capabilities. They will allow our planet to push towards a Greener and Cleaner World where less carbon is emitted into the atmosphere and less land has to be destroyed just to put up solar fields or wind turbines. This will allow the solar glass market to create thousands of new ways to produce energy without sacrificing space, aesthetics, and budget. 

### ***The Future of Solar Glass***

Solar glass has a vast market potential because of its many applications and its ability to generate clean energy and reduce our overall land usage. Many believe it to be the future of solar technology as a whole. Solar glass can produce power equal to rooftop solar panels and benefit the overall efficiency of buildings, vehicles, and mobile devices. The United States has an estimated  5-7 billion square meters(53-75 billion square feet) of glass surface(Lozanova, S, 2022). If we replaced all of the United States' glass windows with solar panels instead, we could generate nearly 40% of the country's energy consumption(Mag, S, 2020). And if we were to implement solar glass with the traditional rooftop solar, we could meet 100% of the United States' energy demands. The only issue is improving energy storage to convert the U.S. to renewable energy effectively.
