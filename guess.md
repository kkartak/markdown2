# How to play the number-guessing game #

Let's document how to play a number-guessing game.
In this game, the computer picks a random number between
1 and 100.
And you have to guess the number.
After each guess, the computer tells you `too high` or 
`too low` to give you a hint for your next guess.
If you guess correctly, the program prints `that's right!`

For example, a sample session of the game
might look like this:

    : 50
    too high
    : 25
    too low
    : 35
    too high
    : 34
    That's right!
    Good Game

And that's the number-guessing game

Four spaces per line creates a block code or double tab space or three back ticks (```) on a line before and after the code
