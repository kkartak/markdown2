# Formatting in Markdown

When you make a bullet list in Markdown, you can start each with `*` or `-`.

## Technical writers often need to create documentation that includes code samples.
These code samples can include:

- sample program output
- something you might type
- actual source code sample
- a program session
- and other things
  * File names
  * folder names
  * program names

### Different uses of list items can cause Markdown to treat them as two separate lists; this will add a space between them.
Example:
* Hi
* Bye
- Howdy
- How are you?
- Goodbye

## Technical writers use Markdown when they are *embedded* with an engineering team.
To create a new GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

1. Click the "New repository" button
2. Enter the repository name
3. Add a description (optional, but a good idea)
4. Use the checkboxes to select options
   1. Add a ReadMe
   2. Don't add a gitignore file
   3. Don't need to pick a license (if it's documentation)

## Block Quotes

If you are writing an email and you're going to quote something back that someone said to you.
You would put the greater-than symbol before each line of text to indicate who said what
In Markdown, you can add inline quotes, or you can insert a block quote for a longer quotation.
Example:

> This is a block quote.
> 
> Hitting enter will continue the block quote on each line.
> To stop it, you would hit the backspace.
